## Task 

By 17th July 2024 :

1. Create a ssh file. Use the prk_method_file, and run a loop lets say for 100k times.
    Store the erros in a file. 
    or, i can even work on for the convergence. 
    The main task is to run the program in remote ssh connection. Once it works, i will be sure that i know how to make the program work in the ssh connection. Later i can run my optimization file over there. 

    Use Tmux for the running the process in background.

2. Start writing the intro part of the thesis, and the detials about ODE and other stuff. I should complete it by 17th July.
