# README for Thesis Supplementary Files

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks (represending results) and the code related to the thesis work on optimizing Runge-Kutta methods for solving Hamiltonian systems. Each file mentioned belowcontains visualizations crucial for understanding the changes and improvements in the numerical methods as a result of optimization techniques applied.

## Files Included

### 1. Final_Plots.ipynb

#### Description
This notebook includes dynamic and energy plots for the Hamiltonian systems considered in the thesis. Plots are provided for both the pre-optimization and post-optimization states to illustrate the effectiveness of the optimization process.

#### Contents
- Dynamics plots showing the trajectory of the system over time.
- Energy plots illustrating the energy conservation before and after the optimization process.

### 2. Error_Convergence_Plot.ipynb

#### Description
This notebook contains the error convergence plots associated with the optimization process of the Runge-Kutta methods.

#### Contents
- Convergence plots detailing the error reduction through successive iterations of the optimization process.
- Visual comparisons of error rates pre- and post-optimization.
